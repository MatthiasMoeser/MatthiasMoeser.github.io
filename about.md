Climate change, debating and start-up companies moved into my focus, while studying [Philosophy & Economics](http://www.pe.uni-bayreuth.de/de/index.html) in Bayreuth, Germany.

Complex systems and programming was added to the list while I studied [Human Decision Science](https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/education/master/master-human-decision-science) in Maastricht, Netherlands.

### What I strive for

My current learning goals are
- expanding knowledge of product management methods and techniques
- becoming Data Science-literate
- understanding how to structure teams and organisations
- getting an overview of existing emissions markets, their effects and flaws

My current action goals are:
- expand my network by meeting with alumni of my former unis (Bayreuth, USP Sao Paulo, Maastricht)
- spend time in the alps
- meditate daily
