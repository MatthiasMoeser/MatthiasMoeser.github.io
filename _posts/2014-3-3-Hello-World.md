Welcome everyone to my blog on github pages. This might finally work out and eventually gather some thoughts which I indend to share with the world public via this channel.

Thanks to [Barry Clark](https://github.com/barryclark) who sufficiently dumbed down for me the needed steps to get this thing working in [his article here](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/).

Happy overcoming doubt!
